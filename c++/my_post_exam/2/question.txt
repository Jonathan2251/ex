Remember do not truncate words.

For example:

input:
The town revolved around the river. In
summer, when the blazing sun beat down, it dozed
under the weight of sultry days. On Main Street a
sow and her litter of pigs might root along the wooden
sidwal, sharing the deeply rutted roadway with
foraging hens and a hound languidly cratching his
fleas.
