The simple multi-core scheduling question can be reduced to article alignment question as follows,

(a). Read an article from input file, in.txt, and adjust it to 60 charactors each line with insert blank between words.
Then output to terminal screen.
Remember do not truncate words with inserting too many blanks.

For example:

The town revolved around the river. In
summer, when the blazing sun beat down, it dozed
under the weight of sultry days. On Main Street a
sow and her litter of pigs might root along the wooden
sidwal, sharing the deeply rutted roadway with
foraging hens and a hound languidly cratching his
fleas.


The  town  revolved  around  the  river. In summer, when the

days. On Main Street a sow and her litter of pigs might root
along  the  wooden sidwal, sharing the deeply rutted roadway
with  foraging  hens  and  a  hound  languidly cratching his
fleas.

(b). Assume word is a serial of continuous jobs, (for example town include 4 jobs), and blank is idle(or context switch). Each line assigning to one-core processor, print the number of blanks for each core processor. For example first core processor include 13 blanks. Print the number of blanks for each core processor.
